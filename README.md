# WAV-mod
The following programs were made during my time learning C programing. All programs rely on proper memory ussage to maintain the 
integrity of a _WAV_ file.

- _Aguilar_Juan_08.c_ : By adjusting the sample and byte rate, a WAV file can be updated to play faster or slower
- _Aguilar_Juan_09.c_ : Utilizing dynamic allocation of memory to store the sin wave into audiodata based on the user's inputs.
